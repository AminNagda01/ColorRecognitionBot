# ImageRecognitionBot

Using Kian Brose's python image recognition tutorial, I made the bot work for a different piano tiles game than the one in the video 

The tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRAIUA-Oc1Y
The game I used: https://lagged.com/en/g/piano-tiles
  - Expand chrome fully on a 1920x1080 monitor, DONT full screen the game, and you should be able to get the same size I did
  - Otherwise, run the screenshot script and keep tweaking iml variable to get the desired region
